# Parameters

A parameter is a numeric property of the legislation which can evolve over time.

Unlike a [variable](./variables.md), a parameter is **not** specific to a specific entity (person, householdâ€¦).

For instance:

- the amount of the minimum wage;
- the amount of family allowance per children;
- the marginal tax scale used to calculate the income tax;

Parameters are used in [formulas](./variables.md#formulas) to calculate variable values.

[Read more about their implementation in OpenFisca](../coding-the-legislation/legislation_parameters.md)
